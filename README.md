## Authentication and Authorization

### Overview

League SZN uses AWS Cognito with email-based sign-in and a 4-tier role hierarchy:

```
Fantasy (lowest) --> Wrestler --> Moderator --> Admin (highest)
```

### Role Permissions

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Fantasy** | Make fantasy picks, view leaderboards, access public data |
| **Wrestler** | All Fantasy permissions + issue/respond to challenges, create promos, manage own profile |
| **Moderator** | All Wrestler permissions + manage wrestlers, matches, championships, tournaments, seasons, divisions, events, fantasy config |
| **Admin** | All Moderator permissions + manage users/roles, clear all data, manage admin-level roles |

### Technical Details

- **Identity Provider**: AWS Cognito User Pool with email-based login
- **Token Lifecycle**: 24-hour access tokens, 24-hour ID tokens, 30-day refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Custom Lambda Authorizer validates JWT tokens on all protected endpoints
- **Role Groups**: Cognito User Pool Groups (Admin, Moderator, Wrestler, Fantasy) with precedence-based hierarchy
- **Key Restriction**: Moderators cannot perform Admin-only operations (clear all data, manage Admin/Moderator roles)
- **Post-Confirmation Trigger**: Lambda function assigns default role group on sign-up

---

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are served under the API Gateway base URL. Admin endpoints require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### API Documentation (OpenAPI / Swagger)

Interactive API docs are available via **Swagger UI**:

- **Local:** When running the backend with `npm run offline` (in `backend/`), open [http://localhost:3001/dev/api-docs](http://localhost:3001/dev/api-docs).
- **Deployed:** Use the same path on your API base URL (e.g. `https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<stage>/api-docs`).

The OpenAPI 3.0 spec is at `backend/docs/openapi.yaml`. To validate it (syntax and refs), from the `backend/` directory run:

```bash
npm run validate-api-docs
```

When you add or change HTTP endpoints in `serverless.yml` or handler request/response shapes, update `backend/docs/openapi.yaml` so the docs stay in sync. After editing the spec or `backend/docs/swagger.html`, run `npm run embed-docs` in `backend/` and commit the updated `functions/docs/docsEmbed.generated.ts` so the deployed API serves the new content.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v20+ (`node --version`)
- **Docker** (for DynamoDB Local)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Quick Start

You'll need **3 terminals** running simultaneously.

Or use the helper scripts from the repo root:

```bash
# Start DynamoDB Local + backend + frontend
# (creates tables and seeds only when local DB is empty)
./scripts/local-dev-up.sh

# Stop everything started by the script
./scripts/local-dev-down.sh
```

Optional: skip seeding by running `SKIP_SEED=1 ./scripts/local-dev-up.sh`.

Port and conflict options:

```bash
# Choose explicit ports
DDB_PORT=8100 BACKEND_PORT=3101 BACKEND_LAMBDA_PORT=3102 FRONTEND_PORT=3100 ./scripts/local-dev-up.sh

# Aggressively clear conflicts on selected ports before startup
KILL_CONFLICTING_PORTS=1 ./scripts/local-dev-up.sh
```

#### Terminal 1 -- DynamoDB Local

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local
```

Leave this running.

#### Terminal 2 -- Backend API

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run offline
```

This starts the API at `http://localhost:3001/dev`. Leave this running.

> **Note:** The `offline` script uses `--stage offline` to disable CloudFormation stack splitting (`serverless-plugin-split-stacks`) which is incompatible with local development. The `--noPrependStageInUrl --prefix dev` flags ensure routes remain at `/dev/*` for frontend compatibility.

#### Terminal 3 -- Seed Data and Frontend

```bash
# Create the DynamoDB tables locally, then seed sample data
cd backend
npm run create-tables
IS_OFFLINE=true npm run seed

# Start the frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### View the App

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser to see the fully populated league.

**Admin Panel**: Navigate to `/admin` and login with credentials: `admin` / `FireGreen48!`

> **Note:** Cognito auth is not available locally. For full auth testing, use the dev environment.

**To reset data:** `cd backend && IS_OFFLINE=true npm run clear-data && IS_OFFLINE=true npm run seed`

### What the Seed Creates

- 3 divisions (Raw, SmackDown, NXT)
- 12 wrestlers with random records
- 1 active season
- 4 championships with history
- 12 matches (8 completed, 4 scheduled)
- 2 tournaments, 3 events
- Contender rankings, fantasy config, site config

### Environment Variables

**Frontend** -- needs a `.env` file using a relative path (Vite proxies API requests to the backend, avoiding CORS issues):

```bash
# frontend/.env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/dev/*` requests to `http://localhost:3001` automatically. Restart Vite after changing `.env` files.

**Backend** -- no `.env` needed. The `serverless-offline` plugin sets `IS_OFFLINE=true` automatically, which configures the backend to use DynamoDB Local at `localhost:8000`. DynamoDB table names use the `-offline` suffix locally (e.g., `universe-tracker-api-wrestlers-offline`). The `create-tables`, `seed`, and `clear-data` scripts default to this suffix.

### Ports

| Service         | Port | Config Location                                      |
| --------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend (Vite) | 3000 | `frontend/vite.config.ts`                            |
| Backend API     | 3001 | `backend/serverless.yml` > `custom.serverless-offline.httpPort` |
| DynamoDB Local  | 8000 | Docker `-p` flag                                     |

### Local Limitations

| Feature        | Works Locally? | Notes                                    |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| DynamoDB       | Yes            | Via DynamoDB Local (Docker)              |
| Lambda / API   | Yes            | Via serverless-offline                   |
| Cognito Auth   | No             | Use dev environment for auth testing     |
| S3 Uploads     | No             | Image uploads require AWS                |
| CloudFront CDN | No             | Only applies to deployed environments    |

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm run offline                       # start local API server
npm run create-tables                 # create local DynamoDB tables
IS_OFFLINE=true npm run seed          # seed sample data
IS_OFFLINE=true npm run clear-data    # wipe all local data
npm test                              # run tests

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev           # start dev server
npm run build         # production build
npm run preview       # preview production build
npm run lint          # run ESLint
npm test              # run tests
```

### Troubleshooting

**"Cannot connect to DynamoDB"**
- Make sure the Docker container is running: `docker ps`
- Verify port 8000: `curl http://localhost:8000`

**"Frontend can't reach backend"**
- Check `frontend/.env` has `VITE_API_BASE_URL=/dev`
- Restart Vite after `.env` changes
- Verify backend is up: `curl http://localhost:3001/dev/wrestlers`

**"Tables not found"**
- Run `npm run create-tables` in the backend directory

**"Port already in use"**
- Kill the process: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9` (swap port as needed)

## Testing

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Tool | Rationale |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Backend unit tests | **Vitest** | ESM-native, fast, works with Serverless/TypeScript |
| Frontend component tests | **Vitest + React Testing Library** | Standard for React 18 + Vite projects |
| Mocking (backend) | **vitest built-in mocks** | Mock DynamoDB DocumentClient, Cognito SDK, S3 client |
| Mocking (frontend) | **vitest built-in mocks + msw** | Mock fetch/API calls, Cognito Amplify SDK |
### Setup Notes

- Frontend: `vitest` + `@testing-library/react` + `@testing-library/jest-dom` + `jsdom`
- Backend: `vitest@3` installed, `vitest.config.mts` configured, `npm test` / `npm run test:watch` scripts added
- Frontend config: `vitest.config.ts` in frontend root; Backend config: `backend/vitest.config.mts`
- Mock pattern: `vi.hoisted()` + `vi.mock()` for AWS SDK, Cognito, S3 clients (established in auth tests)

### Running Tests

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend

# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run lib/__tests__/auth.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npx vitest run --reporter=verbose auth

# Run with coverage
npx vitest run --coverage
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend

npm test
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npx vitest run --coverage
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Dev Pipeline (`deploy-dev.yml`)

**Trigger**: Pull requests opened, updated, or reopened against `main`.

```
Checkout --> Node 24 Setup --> Install Frontend
    |
    +--> Lint (ESLint)
    +--> Typecheck (tsc --noEmit)
    +--> Unit Tests (Vitest)
    |
[Tests pass] --> Deploy Backend (Serverless Framework --> dev stage)
    |
    +--> Set Cognito IDs (hardcoded)
    +--> Install & Build Frontend (Vite, --mode universe)
    +--> S3 Sync (deploy to universe.jpdxsolo.com)
    +--> CloudFront Cache Invalidation
    +--> Deployment Summary
```

### Pipeline Details

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Lint** | ESLint checks across all frontend TypeScript/React files |
| **Typecheck** | TypeScript compiler (`tsc --noEmit`) validates types without emitting output |
| **Unit Tests** | Vitest runs all frontend test suites |
| **Backend Deploy** | Serverless Framework deploys all Lambda functions, API Gateway config, DynamoDB tables, Cognito, S3 buckets, and CloudFront via CloudFormation |
| **Frontend Build** | Vite builds the React SPA with environment-specific API URLs and Cognito config injected |
| **S3 Sync** | Deploys built frontend assets to S3 (with `--delete` to remove stale files, `--exclude "*.map"` to omit source maps) |
| **CloudFront Invalidation** | Invalidates CDN cache (`/*`) to serve fresh content immediately |

---

## Live Environments

| Environment | Frontend | Backend API |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Dev** | https://universe.jpdxsolo.com | TBD after first deploy |

---

## Cost Estimation

With AWS Free Tier:
- DynamoDB: ~$0-1/month (on-demand pricing)
- Lambda: Free for first 1M requests
- API Gateway: Free for first 1M requests
- S3 + CloudFront: ~$0-2/month
- Cognito: Free for up to 50,000 monthly active users

**Expected monthly cost for low traffic: $1-5/month**
